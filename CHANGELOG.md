### Change
- make this package compatible in Windows
    - main change triangle/triangulate.c and triangle/triangulate.h
    - for windows, we must change long into __int64

- 7/11/2022: tested compatible with latest vtk==9.0.3, latest mayavi==4.7.4, and old PyQt5==5.15.6 on python==3.9.12 on Linux(Ubuntu 20.04.3) , macOS(Monterey 12.1 intel) , HPC(CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)) and Windows(Windows 10 pro 21H2).

### Change
- simulate overhang htrap(3D electrode): original code(especially triangulation part) behaves bad for 3D trap, so a lot of changes are made in Bem.
    - unify same points in mesh structure
    - counter clockwise triangle when passed into the package
    - originally, parallel planes will be classified as one plane, which leads to error for 3D cases. Fix now
    - now we can combine triangles first and cut it, so sharp triangles are eliminated
    - fix the error: exceed float precision .......
- a more convenient way to load color (explained in the document)
    - a set of standard color
    - more regular color names
- simplify the environment set up process, with one command: pip install .
    - setup.py, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml and MANIFEST.in
- compatible with python 3.9
    - solve the problem of multiprocessing
    - solve the environment for mayavi PyQt vtk
    - get around mayavi in our workflow
        - our code can run on HPC(CentOs)
        - saves a lot of effort to maintain the code in the future
- others
    - make unit problem clear(micronmeter or millimeter are both ok now)
    - split readme into readme+changelog+copying
    - bugs in ./fastlap
    - other small bugs

- add a document: ./examples/document
